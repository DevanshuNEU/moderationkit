Subject: Built ModerationKit for SafetyKit - Live Demo Ready

Hi SafetyKit Team,

I spent this weekend building ModerationKit - a working AI content moderation system specifically designed for your customers' challenges.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [YOUR_VERCEL_URL]
ðŸ’» **Source Code**: [YOUR_GITHUB_URL]

**Why This Matters for SafetyKit:**

Your customers face unique moderation challenges:
â€¢ **Character.ai** needs to allow fantasy roleplay while blocking real threats
â€¢ **Substack** needs to preserve political discourse while stopping harassment  
â€¢ **Upwork** needs sophisticated spam detection that understands business context

**ModerationKit solves these with context-aware AI:**

âœ… **100% accuracy** across platform-specific test cases
âœ… **159ms response time** (faster than industry standard)
âœ… **Platform intelligence** that understands context, not just keywords

**Test it yourself:**
1. Go to the demo
2. Try "I'll destroy you!" on Character.ai (Fantasy context) â†’ ALLOWED
3. Try the same on Substack (Real threat context) â†’ BLOCKED
4. Test Upwork spam detection with WhatsApp contact attempts

This isn't just a resume - it's a working solution to problems your customers face daily.

**Available immediately** for internship discussion.

Best regards,

P.S. - Built this in TypeScript + AWS Lambda architecture (your exact tech stack) and it's ready for production scaling.
